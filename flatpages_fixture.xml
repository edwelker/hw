&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Consulting&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
Whether you are looking to define a project architecture, determine an
appropriate development methodology or implement a specific design we can help you. Our needs-based approach to consulting projects ensures that you meet your overall goal.&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Teaching&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
We teach classes in networking technologies, network security and
database design for Learning Tree International, and other classes independently. Please ask us to quote for your training needs.&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Speaking&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
We can speak on a range of topics, with presentation styles suitable for either technical or managerial audiences. This can be a cost-effective way to investigate the feasibility of a new technology for your organization.&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Advocacy&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
The open source world has a lot to offer commercial and governmental organizations bold enough to move away from the classical software purchase cycle, and we invest time in helping such organizations to investigate their options.&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many projects involve new and interesting technologies. Holden Web
works with the latest technolgies, many of the emerging techniques
involving open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
 
&lt;p&gt;Operating system and application software choice is never a religious issue here: we evaluate the range of available products and use what is most appropriate for each project and most convenient to our customers. We work with all operating system platforms and a wide range of tools.&lt;/p&gt;
 
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; is our open source agile programming language of choice. International contacts extend our skills base in multiple technologies including security, graphic and information design and application and network systems architectures. For web development we like work as a part of a team that uses graphic design skills of your existing design team to our proven technical abilities.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Early in 2002 New Riders published Steve Holden's first book, &lt;i&gt;Python Web Programming&lt;/i&gt; (see below). In March 2003 Steve chaired the inaugural &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/pycon/"&gt;PyCon DC 2003&lt;/a&gt; Python Community Conference, at which he was delighted to meet many readers of this web site. He also chaired PyCon DC 2004 and 2005. Sometimes you will still find him on &lt;a href="news:comp.lang.python" title="look on your news server"&gt;comp.lang.python&lt;/a&gt;, the most useful newsgroup for the general Python user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source is an increasingly ubiquitous component of the information architectures of all kinds of organisation. As large users come to realise they have to rely on open architectures to keep IT costs down, familiarity with the open source world will pay dividends to far-sighted investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present open source developers and large-scale IT users are sizing each other up, looking for suitable ways to work together and both benefit. The advantages to commercial organisations should be obvious: they include access to high-quality software, a skilled and often responsive maintenance team and reduced costs of acquisition. Open source developers are frequently in need of various kinds of support: travel expenses to attend conferences and sprints, computer equipment and internet hosting are frequently mentioned, and many project web sites now allow you to make donations by credit card or PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some open source projects dominate their product space. Apache is still the dominant web server, and Samba is probably the leading Unix-to-Windows file- and print-sharing solution. Several commentators have observed that the software product space is becoming a commodity market in areas like this, where applications are well-defined and relatively easy to standardise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open source projects will benefit from more commercial support, and Holden Web encourages all those involved in commercial IT to consider how they can provide such support.&lt;/p&gt;</field>

&lt;h2&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Techologies deployed on projects have been determined by clients needs. Programming languages have included Python, Perl, Cold Fusion, JavaScript and VBScript. with databases such as Access, SQL Server 6.5 through 2000, and MySQL. We teach technology classes for Learning Tree International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our skill set spans a range of platforms, including both UNIX and Windows. We are based in the United States and the United Kingdom. Projects can have worldwide scope and make use of an international network of professional contacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use web and Internet technologies to help people meet their information needs, and are always happy to discuss potential projects. Roles can vary from strategic consulting and design through programming team leadership to development programmer. Contact details are at the bottom of each page of this site.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Project highlights&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1996 Steve Holden was the technical lead on a project to re-vamp the NSF's web site, applying a unified look and feel to a wide variety of information sources and making information easier to locate. Automatic content generation techniques allowed the NSF to rebuild the site quickly. A lot has changed since then, but the general flavor of the site is still the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;GlobalPhone Corporation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A straightforward web site whose page structures are built by program from a common data structure, so links are updated everywhere as soon as the controlling data structure is changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Web CallBack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A database-driven site where people can sign up for service on-line and have their web sites making telephone calls in double-quick time. A lot of the system's administration is also web-based, though this is not visible through the site's public interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Thomson Prometric&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 1998 (before the ready availability of stylesheets), Prometric wanted a technology that let them separate content from look-and-feel. We delivered a system that let them update their update their site content by modifying a database through a private web interface, so they could add news items and respond immediately to changes. During development a complete revision of the site's look-and-feel was accomplished in a single day by changing just one file and modifying the attached graphics.&lt;/p&gt;</field>
